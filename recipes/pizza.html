            <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, ensuring even coverage.</li>
            <li>Lay the salami slices on top of the cheese, spacing them evenly across the pizza.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle dried oregano, basil, salt, and pepper over the pizza for added flavor.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let the pizza cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired, then slice and serve hot!</li>
